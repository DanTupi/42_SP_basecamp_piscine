# 42 Sao Paulo - Basecamp (the on-line piscine)

"The Piscine is the final trial that will grant you your admission to 42" (from [the official site](https://www.42.fr/en/la-piscine/)).

Due to Covid-19 and the global pandemic we had in 2020 a brand new branch of the french school settled in SÃ£o Paulo, Brasil decided to create an on-line version of the final trial.

This Repository contains functions and scripts I made in 20 days immersion, there a couple lists of shell's scripts, and half dozen of list of functions in C language.

>Notice I'm only posting the functions, not a program _per say_, if you want to know if it works or what are the results of the function, contact me and I will be more than happy to show you the full process.
>I am not posting the whole thing because it can made a soon-to-be-cadet in 42 have a worse psicine (or basecamp) experience.
